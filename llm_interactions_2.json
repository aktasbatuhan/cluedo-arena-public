Additionally, Mr. Green has been consistently suggested and never eliminated, and the Dagger has been frequently suggested without being proven incorrect. The Kitchen was suggested by me and not challenged, further supporting its potential as the solution room. While not 100% certain, the lack of challenges and consistent patterns provide strong evidence to risk an accusation."

No challenge.\n\nBased on your knowledge and location (Conservatory), make a strategic suggestion (suspect, weapon, room).\nThe suggested room MUST be your current location: Conservatory.\nYour goal is to gain new information by forcing others to reveal cards.

      "prompt": "You are Purple Agent. Turn 21. Decide if you should make a final accusation to win.\n\nYour knowledge:\n- Your Hand: Candlestick, Dining Room, Professor Plum\n- Eliminated Cards (Not in Solution): Revolver, Conservatory, Study, Mr. Green, Lounge, Library\n- Suspected Cards: {}\n- Current Deductions Summary: My current hand includes Candlestick, Dining Room, and Professor Plum. Known eliminated cards are Revolver, Conservatory, Study, Mr. Green, Lounge, and now Library. My suspicions remain focused on Dagger and Kitchen, as these cards have been repeatedly implicated by other players' actions or suggestions. The inability to disprove my suggestion of Mrs. Peacock, Dagger, and Library further reinforces the elimination of Library. The repeated focus on Dagger and Kitchen, along with the reinforced elimination of Conservatory, Study, and now Library, and the continued elimination of Mr. Green, Revolver, and Lounge, all contribute to narrowing down the potential solution. Blue Agent's action of showing a card to Orange Agent remains unclear without knowing the card. I will continue to monitor suggestions and actions to refine my deductions and narrow down the solution. Key insights include the growing suspicion around Dagger and Kitchen, the reinforced elimination of Conservatory, Study, and Library, and the continued elimination of Mr. Green, Revolver, Lounge, and Library.\n- Turn History Highlights:\nTurn 1: Red Agent suggested Mr. Green, Revolver, Kitchen. Orange Agent showed a card.\nTurn 3: Blue Agent suggested Mr. Green, Dagger, Conservatory. Red Agent showed a card.\nTurn 5: Green Agent suggested Mr. Green, Dagger, Study. Red Agent showed a card.\nTurn 7: Yellow Agent suggested Mr. Green, Dagger, Conservatory. Red Agent showed a card.\nTurn 9: Purple Agent suggested Mr. Green, Dagger, Library. Red Agent showed a card.\nTurn 11: Orange Agent suggested Mrs. Peacock, Dagger, Lounge. Blue Agent showed a card.\nTurn 13: Red Agent suggested Mr. Green, Dagger, Kitchen. No challenge.\nTurn 15: Blue Agent suggested Mrs. Peacock, Dagger, Conservatory. No challenge.\nTurn 17: Green Agent suggested Mrs. Peacock, Dagger, Study. No challenge.\nTurn 19: Yellow Agent suggested Mrs. Peacock, Dagger, Conservatory. No challenge.\nTurn 21: Purple Agent suggested Mrs. Peacock, Dagger, Library. No challenge.\n\nCurrent Turn Events (Turn 21):\nThis turn, you suggested: Mrs. Peacock, Dagger, Library.\nResult: NO ONE could challenge your suggestion.\n\nCLUEDO LOGIC REMINDERS:\n1. No challenge to a suggestion implies suggested cards MIGHT be the solution.\n2. A challenge proves AT LEAST ONE suggested card is NOT the solution.\n3. Elimination: If 5/6 suspects are known, the last one IS the solution suspect.\n4. You can risk an accusation without 100% certainty based on strong evidence.\n\nConsider accusing if:\n- You have strong evidence/elimination for all 3 solution components.\n- A key suggestion was unchallenged.\n\nRespond ONLY with a YAML object in the following format.\nIf shouldAccuse is true, provide your deduced solution.\nIf shouldAccuse is false, provide null for accusation components.\n\nshouldAccuse: <boolean>\naccusation:\n  suspect: <string | null, one of Miss Scarlet | Colonel Mustard | Mrs. White | Mr. Green | Mrs. Peacock | Professor Plum or null>\n  weapon: <string | null, one of Candlestick | Dagger | Lead Pipe | Revolver | Rope | Wrench or null>\n  room: <string | null, one of Kitchen | Ballroom | Conservatory | Dining Room | Billiard Room | Library | Lounge | Hall | Study or null>\nreasoning: <string, explain your decision and confidence level>",
