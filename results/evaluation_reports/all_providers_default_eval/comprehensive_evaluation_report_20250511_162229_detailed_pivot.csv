A deduction is a card that you can definitively conclude is NOT part of the murder solution. Deduce cards when:
1. It's in your hand.
2. Another player shows it to you.
3. You can logically prove it must be held by a specific player or eliminated.

Your most recent memory note:
ELIMINATED CARDS: - In my hand: Lounge, Library, Colonel Mustard - Previously confirmed: Kitchen, Mrs. Peacock, Dining Room, Lead Pipe, Professor Plum
KEY PATTERNS & INSIGHTS: 1. Weapon patterns: - Candlestick appears frequently in suggestions without confirmation - Lead Pipe is eliminated - Other weapons have been suggested less frequently - Wrench just appeared in Red's suggestion
2. Room patterns: - Several rooms remain unexplored (Study, Conservatory, Ballroom) - Kitchen, Dining Room are eliminated - Hall has been featured in Yellow's recent suggestions
3. Suspect patterns: - Professor Plum and Mrs. Peacock are eliminated - Miss Scarlet was previously suggested by Green - Colonel Mustard (in my hand) just suggested again by Red
STRATEGY FOCUS: - Continue monitoring repeated suggestions - Watch for players suggesting previously shown cards - Pay particular attention to weapon suggestions due to their relative infrequency - Track unexplored rooms - Note that Red just suggested two known eliminated cards (Kitchen and Colonel Mustard) - this might be significant

2. Previous notable patterns remain significant: - Orange's earlier suggestion using all eliminated cards (Professor Plum, Candlestick, Kitchen) might have been information gathering - Blue's early game showing of Kitchen instead of Mrs. Peacock/Candlestick remains noteworthy - Blue's previous suggestion of Mrs. Peacock despite its potential solution status still relevant
Status of categories: - Suspects: Miss Scarlet, Colonel Mustard, Mr. Green remain possible solution cards - Weapons: Revolver, Rope, Wrench remain unverified - Rooms: Study, Hall, Library, Ballroom remain unverified

Notable information: - Duplicate card identified: Lead Pipe (held by both Purple and Green) - Blue was previously shown either Colonel Mustard or Wrench by Red, but can't determine which - Green's latest suggestion (Colonel Mustard/Revolver/Dining Room) might indicate interest in those suspects/weapons - Blue's recent Miss Scarlet/Candlestick/Dining Room suggestion involved two cards I hold

A deduction is a card that you can definitively conclude is NOT part of the murder solution. Deduce cards when:
1. It's in your hand.
2. Another player shows it to you.
3. You can logically prove it must be held by a specific player or eliminated.

Current Eliminated Cards (11): Rope, Dining Room, Candlestick (my hand), Kitchen, Mrs. Peacock, Lead Pipe, Lounge, Professor Plum, Miss Scarlet, Colonel Mustard, Revolver
Known Card Locations: - Purple has: Lead Pipe, Miss Scarlet - Orange has: Lounge - Red has: Professor Plum - Green has: Lead Pipe - Blue has: Revolver (newly deduced) - I've shown Dining Room to Green multiple times - I've shown Candlestick to Blue
Key Insights: 1. Lead Pipe is confirmed as a duplicate (seen with both Purple and Green) 2. Cards still unaccounted for include: Mrs. White, Wrench, Study, Library, Hall, Ballroom, Conservatory, Billiard Room 3. Blue's possession of Revolver helps explain previous suggestion patterns 4. Most suspects have been eliminated (only Mrs. White remains unaccounted for) 5. Rooms remain the least resolved category 6. Weapons category is progressing well with Lead Pipe (duplicate), Rope, Candlestick, and Revolver eliminated
This updated understanding suggests focusing on remaining rooms and Mrs. White in future suggestions.

Events from THIS turn:
Red Agent suggested: Mr. Green, Rope, Kitchen.

Key tracking points: 1. Murder room must be Kitchen, Hall, Lounge, Library, or Study (all others eliminated) 2. Three weapons confirmed not involved: Lead Pipe, Candlestick 3. Colonel Mustard continues to appear in suggestions but remains unconfirmed 4. Study is confirmed in Green's hand (from previous deduction) 5.

Turn 9: Purple suggested Colonel Mustard, Revolver, Billiard Room. Orange showed a card. 6. Turn 11: Orange suggested Colonel Mustard, Revolver, Ballroom. Red showed a card.
Notable Patterns and Deductions: - Colonel Mustard has been suggested four times (Turns 1, 7, 9, and 11) without being shown, making it a strong suspect - Revolver has been suggested three times (Turn 5, 9, and 11) without being definitively shown, also a strong suspect - Orange definitely doesn't have Colonel Mustard (proven by Turn 7) - Study and Conservatory suggestions remain unresolved - 9 cards are now confirmed eliminated - The repeated suggestions of Colonel Mustard and Revolver without being shown make them increasingly likely to be part of the solution - The fact that Red showed a card to Orange's suggestion helps confirm Ballroom is eliminated

Your most recent memory note:
Currently eliminated cards (7 total): - From my hand: Professor Plum, Miss Scarlet, Dining Room - Previously deduced/shown: Colonel Mustard, Revolver, Mr. Green, Mrs. Peacock, Lead Pipe
Key knowledge: - Yellow Agent definitely holds the Revolver (confirmed when shown to Blue earlier) - Yellow Agent's suggestion with known eliminated Mr. Green suggests they may be struggling with tracking information - Orange just suggested Mrs. Peacock/Lead Pipe/Ballroom, and Yellow showed them a card - Lead Pipe has appeared in multiple suggestions (Yellow's, Purple's, now Orange's) - The Study appeared in Blue's suggestion but remains unconfirmed - Blue has shown cards to multiple players, suggesting they may hold several key cards - I've shown Purple the Dining Room in response to their suggestion
No new definitive deductions can be made from this turn's events, as Yellow showing an unknown card to Orange could be any of the cards in Orange's suggestion (Lead Pipe, Ballroom, or something else Yellow holds). We'd need more specific information to make additional deductions.

Your most recent memory note:
Cards in my hand: Mrs. Peacock, Mr. Green, Lead Pipe. Known eliminated cards are now: Study, Professor Plum, Candlestick, Dagger, and Kitchen. From Turn 1, Blue showed either Professor Plum or Candlestick in response to Red's suggestion (Professor Plum, Candlestick, Study), and one of these is definitely held by Blue. When Blue suggested Miss Scarlet, Dagger, Lounge on Turn 3, Green showed one of these cards, confirming Dagger is eliminated but we can't determine which specific card was shown. Now on this turn, when Green suggested Miss Scarlet, Candlestick, Kitchen, Yellow showed Kitchen (we can deduce this because Candlestick was already eliminated and Miss Scarlet's status is unknown). We know Kitchen is held by Yellow Player. Miss Scarlet and Lounge remain uncertain. We haven't seen any suggestions involving most weapons or rooms yet.

Important: For this memory update, do NOT list cards that are already in your hand as 'newlyDeducedCards'. Focus ONLY on cards that you have deduced for the first time based on the game events from *this* turn or by logical inference from other players' actions or revealed cards. Cards from your own hand should already be part of your permanent memory and not re-stated as 'newly deduced' in this update. 

You are Red Agent. Analyze the events from your last turn (Turn 31) and update your memory and deductions.

WHAT IS A DEDUCTION:
A deduction is a card that you can definitively conclude is NOT part of the murder solution. Deduce cards when:
1. It's in your hand.
2. Another player shows it to you.
3. You can logically prove it must be held by a specific player or eliminated.

Based ONLY on the information above, what new cards can you definitively deduce are NOT part of the solution?

Important: In your response for `newlyDeducedCards`, list only those cards that became definitively known as 'not part of the solution' *during this specific turn's events*. Do not re-list cards from your hand or other pre-existing knowledge if their status as a deduction was already established *before* this turn's events.

Remember: A deduction must be 100% certain.

Cards in my hand: Professor Plum, Miss Scarlet, Dining Room
Known Eliminated Cards: Colonel Mustard, Revolver, Mr. Green, Lead Pipe, Mrs. Peacock, Wrench, Mrs. White, Study, Rope, Library, Candlestick, Dagger
Your most recent memory note:
COMPLETE SOLUTION STATUS: We continue to have complete certainty of the murder solution: Mrs. White (suspect), Lead Pipe (weapon), Study (room).
Total eliminated cards remains at 14: My hand: Professor Plum, Miss Scarlet, Dining Room Definitively deduced/shown cards: Colonel Mustard, Revolver, Mr. Green, Lead Pipe, Mrs. Peacock, Wrench, Mrs. White, Study, Rope, Library, Candlestick, Dagger
Confirmed card holdings: - Yellow Agent: Revolver - Green Agent: Library, Wrench - Blue Agent: Dagger
Key game history: 1. Yellow's earlier suggestion using Mrs. White and Lead Pipe with Library was likely verification 2. Purple's suggestion using my cards (Professor Plum, Dining Room) helped deduce Candlestick when Orange showed a card 3. My suggestion of Mr. Green, Dagger, Dining Room led to Blue showing Mr. Green, confirming Dagger's location 4. Blue successfully suggested the complete solution (Mrs. White, Lead Pipe, Study) 5. This turn: Green suggested Professor Plum, Wrench, Library - I showed Professor Plum, but this added no new information as these were all known cards
The game is effectively over as we have confirmed all solution cards with certainty: Mrs. White (suspect), Lead Pipe (weapon), Study (room).

KEY INSIGHTS: 1. Blue holds Professor Plum (shown to Red in Turn 1) 2. Green holds at least one of {Miss Scarlet, Dagger, Lounge} (shown to Blue in Turn 3) 3.

You are Purple Agent. Analyze the events from your last turn (Turn 9) and update your memory and deductions.

WHAT IS A DEDUCTION:
A deduction is a card that you can definitively conclude is NOT part of the murder solution. Deduce cards when:
1. It's in your hand.
2. Another player shows it to you.
3. You can logically prove it must be held by a specific player or eliminated.

Prior notable interactions:
- Blue suggested Mr. Green/Revolver/Dining Room (I showed Revolver)
- Green suggested Mrs. Peacock/Dagger/Ballroom (Yellow showed a card)
- Yellow just suggested Miss Scarlet/Lead Pipe/Study (I showed Study)

Key deductions and insights:
- Blue likely has Mrs. Peacock (deduced from when Red suggested Study/Mrs. Peacock/Candlestick and Blue showed a card - since I have Study and Candlestick was eliminated, Blue must have shown Mrs. Peacock)
- Yellow has Lead Pipe (newly deduced from this turn's interaction)
- Yellow holds at least one of: Mrs. Peacock, Ballroom (from previous turn when they showed Green a card during Green's Mrs. Peacock/Dagger/Ballroom suggestion)
- We've eliminated three weapons (Candlestick, Dagger, Revolver, Lead Pipe)

Events from THIS turn:
I suggested: Mrs. Peacock, Rope, Lounge.
Blue Agent showed me the card: Lounge.

This turn, Green Agent suggested Colonel Mustard, Candlestick, Kitchen, and Purple Agent showed an unknown card. The showing of cards by Purple Agent in consecutive turns might indicate they hold multiple commonly suggested items.

KEY OBSERVATIONS: 1. Pattern continues of players using eliminated cards in suggestions (several examples) 2. Purple has shown cards for multiple suggestions involving Candlestick, suggesting they may have it 3. I just showed Conservatory to Purple's suggestion 4. Previous turn, Blue showed a card to Yellow's Mrs. Peacock/Candlestick/Study suggestion
TRACKING PATTERNS: 1. Multiple players (Red, Blue, Green, Yellow) have been using already-eliminated cards in their suggestions 2. Purple's suggestions and responses frequently involve the Candlestick 3. Currently cannot definitively deduce any additional cards
The game continues to show strategic use of eliminated cards in suggestions, possibly to gain information while revealing less about their own hands. Purple's repeated involvement with Candlestick suggestions remains a point of interest but doesn't yet allow for definitive deductions.

Key insights and patterns: - Green has proven possession of Dagger - Purple likely has Candlestick (based on multiple suggestion patterns) - Orange's Turn 11 suggestion (Professor Plum, Candlestick, Ballroom) resulted in Yellow showing one of these cards - Only Mr. Green and Mrs. White remain as possible suspects - Remaining possible rooms: Study, Library, Hall, Lounge, Ballroom, Dining Room, Billiard Room - Remaining possible weapons: Lead Pipe, Rope, Candlestick
Suspicions: - Purple's continued inclusion of Candlestick suggests they may possess this card - Latest interaction between Orange and Yellow gives us new tracking data for Professor Plum, Candlestick, or Ballroom - With 9 cards now eliminated, we're getting closer to identifying the solution - The suspect pool has significantly narrowed to just two possibilities

WHAT IS A DEDUCTION:
A deduction is a card that you can definitively conclude is NOT part of the murder solution. Deduce cards when:
1. It's in your hand.
2. Another player shows it to you.
3. You can logically prove it must be held by a specific player or eliminated.

Your current knowledge:
Cards in my hand: Mrs. Peacock, Mr. Green, Lead Pipe
Known Eliminated Cards: Study, Professor Plum, Candlestick, Dagger, Kitchen, Colonel Mustard, Ballroom, Mrs. White
Your most recent memory note:
Cards in hand: Mrs. Peacock, Mr. Green, Lead Pipe. Known eliminated cards remain: Study, Professor Plum, Candlestick, Dagger, Kitchen, Colonel Mustard, Ballroom, Mrs. White. Key player holdings: Blue holds either Professor Plum or Candlestick (from Turn 1). Green holds one of either Miss Scarlet or Lounge (from Turn 3). Yellow definitely holds Kitchen. Red holds Colonel Mustard and showed Ballroom to Orange. Blue must have shown Mrs. White to Red's recent suggestion. NEW DEVELOPMENT: Blue's suggestion of Miss Scarlet, Wrench, Lounge received no responses, making these strong solution candidates. This aligns with previous knowledge that Wrench and Lounge were never shown when suggested. Miss Scarlet was previously known to be either held by Green or part of solution - this suggestion strengthens the possibility it's in the solution. Given the lack of responses to this suggestion, there's a strong possibility these three cards are the solution, but we cannot yet confirm this with absolute certainty. The distribution of weapons and rooms remains relatively unknown due to limited suggestions involving these categories throughout the game.

ELIMINATED CARDS: - In my hand: Dining Room, Billiard Room, Conservatory - Definitively shown/deduced: Miss Scarlet, Colonel Mustard, Mrs. Peacock, Dagger, Professor Plum, Mr. Green
KEY KNOWLEDGE: 1. Professor Plum is confirmed to be held by Yellow Agent 2. Candlestick continues to appear frequently: - Multiple suggestions involving it by Purple and now Blue - Blue previously showed a card for Mrs. Peacock/Candlestick/Study suggestion - Yellow has shown cards for Candlestick suggestions multiple times - Still cannot definitively determine its location 3. Blue's latest suggestion using Mrs. White is notable as one of few suggestions with this suspect
PATTERN ANALYSIS: - Players continue strategic use of known eliminated cards - Blue's suggestion of Conservatory (which I had to show) might indicate they're trying to identify card holders - Candlestick remains a frequently suggested weapon, appearing in suggestions from multiple players
UNCERTAINTIES: - Cannot definitively determine Candlestick's location despite its frequent appearance - Mrs. White's status remains unclear - Study's location still uncertain despite previous suggestions
NEXT STEPS: - Continue monitoring Candlestick-related suggestions and responses - Pay attention to suggestions involving Mrs. White as this suspect appears less frequently

SOLUTION CONFIRMED:
- Murderer: Mrs. White
- Weapon: Candlestick
- Location: Study

KEY INSIGHTS:
1. Yellow Agent's undisproven suggestion has revealed the complete solution
2. Previous uncertainty about Candlestick's location is now resolved
3. All prior observations about Mrs. White and Study patterns led to this conclusion
4. The game should now be effectively over, as we have confirmed all three solution cards

This represents a complete resolution of all previous uncertainties, as Yellow Agent's suggestion and the inability of any player to disprove it definitively revealed the solution.

Key Conclusions: 1. Mrs. White is CONFIRMED as the murderer (all other suspects eliminated) 2. Weapon must be either Lead Pipe or Rope (only remaining possibilities) 3. Remaining possible rooms: Library, Hall, Lounge, Dining Room, Billiard Room
Strategic Understanding: - Solution is now narrowed to: Mrs. White + (Lead Pipe/Rope) + (one of 5 rooms) - 14 total cards eliminated (including my hand) - Ballroom was just deduced as non-solution through Orange's suggestion that no one could disprove - Next suggestions should focus on: * Testing Lead Pipe vs Rope combinations * Investigating remaining unconfirmed rooms (Library, Hall, Lounge, Dining Room, Billiard Room)

Important: For this memory update, do NOT list cards that are already in your hand as 'newlyDeducedCards'. Focus ONLY on cards that you have deduced for the first time based on the game events from *this* turn or by logical inference from other players' actions or revealed cards. Cards from your own hand should already be part of your permanent memory and not re-stated as 'newly deduced' in this update. 

You are Red Agent. Analyze the events from your last turn (Turn 7) and update your memory and deductions.

WHAT IS A DEDUCTION:
A deduction is a card that you can definitively conclude is NOT part of the murder solution. Deduce cards when:
1. It's in your hand.
2. Another player shows it to you.
3. You can logically prove it must be held by a specific player or eliminated.

Your current knowledge:
Cards in my hand: Dagger, Study, Billiard Room
Known Eliminated Cards: Candlestick, Mrs. White, Hall
Your most recent memory note:
Current Knowledge: - Cards in my hand: Dagger, Study, Billiard Room (these cannot be the solution) - Known eliminated cards through previous deductions: Candlestick (shown by Orange), Mrs. White (eliminated earlier), Hall - From my previous suggestion (Colonel Mustard, Candlestick, Billiard Room): * Billiard Room confirmed not solution (in my hand) * Candlestick confirmed not solution (shown by Orange) * Colonel Mustard's status remains unknown - From Blue's suggestion (Mrs. White, Dagger, Study): * All three cards were already known to be eliminated * Green showed a card to Blue - From Green's latest suggestion (Colonel Mustard, Lead Pipe, Hall): * Hall was already known to be eliminated * Yellow showed one card, but cannot determine which - Total confirmed eliminated cards: Dagger, Study, Billiard Room, Candlestick, Mrs. White, Hall - No new definitive deductions possible from current information - Still need to determine status of: Colonel Mustard, Lead Pipe, and many other cards

Cards in my hand: Dining Room, Hall, Professor Plum
Known Eliminated Cards: Candlestick, Mrs. White, Dagger
Your most recent memory note:
Current Knowledge: - Cards in my hand: Dining Room, Hall, Professor Plum (definitely not in solution) - Previously eliminated: Candlestick, Mrs. White - Total eliminated cards remain at 5 (my 3 hand cards + Candlestick + Mrs. White)
Key Event History: - Red Agent suggested Colonel Mustard, Candlestick, Billiard Room * Orange Agent showed one of these (must be Colonel Mustard or Billiard Room since Candlestick eliminated) - Blue Agent suggested Mrs. White, Dagger, Study * Green showed a card to Blue (must be Dagger or Study since Mrs. White eliminated) - Green Agent just suggested Colonel Mustard, Lead Pipe, Hall * I showed Hall to Green
Key Deductions/Suspicions: - Orange must have either Colonel Mustard or Billiard Room - Green must have either Dagger or Study - Just responded to Green's suggestion with Hall - Still waiting for more information to make additional concrete deductions
Total cards definitively eliminated remains at 5: Dining Room, Hall, Professor Plum, Candlestick, Mrs. White
