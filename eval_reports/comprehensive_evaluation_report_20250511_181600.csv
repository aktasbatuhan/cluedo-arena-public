Important: For this memory update, do NOT list cards that are already in your hand as 'newlyDeducedCards'. Focus ONLY on cards that you have deduced for the first time based on the game events from *this* turn or by logical inference from other players' actions or revealed cards. Cards from your own hand should already be part of your permanent memory and not re-stated as 'newly deduced' in this update. 

You are Orange Agent. Analyze the events from your last turn (Turn 17) and update your memory and deductions.

WHAT IS A DEDUCTION:
A deduction is a card that you can definitively conclude is NOT part of the murder solution. Deduce cards when:
1. It's in your hand.
2. Another player shows it to you.
3. You can logically prove it must be held by a specific player or eliminated.

newlyDeducedCards:
  - <string> # Card name, or empty list if none
reasoning: <string> # Explain exactly how you deduced each new card
memorySummary: <string> # DETAILED summary of your CURRENT understanding. Include ALL known eliminated cards (hand + deduced), suspicions, and key insights from the game history.

Based ONLY on the information above, what new cards can you definitively deduce are NOT part of the solution?

Important: In your response for `newlyDeducedCards`, list only those cards that became definitively known as 'not part of the solution' *during this specific turn's events*. Do not re-list cards from your hand or other pre-existing knowledge if their status as a deduction was already established *before* this turn's events.

Remember: A deduction must be 100% certain.

ELIMINATED CARDS: - In my hand: Dining Room, Billiard Room, Conservatory - Definitively shown/deduced: Miss Scarlet, Colonel Mustard, Mrs. Peacock, Dagger, Professor Plum, Mr. Green
KEY KNOWLEDGE: 1. Professor Plum is confirmed to be held by Yellow Agent 2. Candlestick continues to appear frequently: - Multiple suggestions involving it by Purple and now Blue - Blue previously showed a card for Mrs. Peacock/Candlestick/Study suggestion - Yellow has shown cards for Candlestick suggestions multiple times - Still cannot definitively determine its location 3. Blue's latest suggestion using Mrs. White is notable as one of few suggestions with this suspect
PATTERN ANALYSIS: - Players continue strategic use of known eliminated cards - Blue's suggestion of Conservatory (which I had to show) might indicate they're trying to identify card holders - Candlestick remains a frequently suggested weapon, appearing in suggestions from multiple players
UNCERTAINTIES: - Cannot definitively determine Candlestick's location despite its frequent appearance - Mrs. White's status remains unclear - Study's location still uncertain despite previous suggestions
NEXT STEPS: - Continue monitoring Candlestick-related suggestions and responses - Pay attention to suggestions involving Mrs. White as this suspect appears less frequently

  KEY KNOWLEDGE: 
  1. Professor Plum is confirmed to be held by Yellow Agent.

  3. Blue Agent's suggestion of the Kitchen and Mrs. White is notable, as this suspect has been suggested less frequently than others. 


  PATTERN ANALYSIS: Strategic use of known eliminated cards continues. Blue Agent's suggestion of the Conservatory may have been an attempt to identify card holders. The Candlestick remains a popular weapon suggestion, but its location is unclear despite Yellow Agent showing candlestick cards on multiple occasions. 


  UNCERTAINTIES: Candlestick's location and Mrs. White's status remain uncertain. The Study's location is also unclear, despite previous suggestions. 


  NEXT STEPS: Continue monitoring Candlestick suggestions and responses. Pay close attention to Mrs. White suggestions due to her infrequent appearance.

reasoning: Green Agent's suggestion of Kitchen, combined with Red Agent showing a card to Green, strengthens the deduction that Kitchen is not involved in the murder. This is based on the strategic use of known eliminated cards and the lack of any recent suggestions involving Kitchen.

memorySummary: 
My current understanding is based on the elimination of several key cards and the strategic play of my opponents. Here's a summary:

- **Eliminated Cards:** Dagger, Dining Room, Billiard Room, Conservatory, Miss Scarlet, Colonel Mustard, Mrs. Peacock, Professor Plum, Mr. Green.

- **Suspects:** The remaining suspects are Mrs. White, Mrs. Green (based on Green Agent's actions), and potentially Mrs. Peacock (though her involvement is less certain).

- **Weapon:** Candlestick continues to be a frequently suggested weapon, despite its location remaining unknown.

- **Rooms:** The Study and Kitchen are now less likely to be involved, while the other rooms remain in play.

- **Pattern Analysis:**  Players are strategically using the eliminated cards in their suggestions, indicating a complex web of deductions. Blue Agent's recent focus on Mrs. White and the Conservatory might be a ploy to mislead.

- **Uncertainties:** The location of Candlestick and Mrs. White's involvement remain unclear.

- **Next Steps:** I will continue to monitor suggestions related to Candlestick and Mrs. White, while also paying attention to any new information that arises from other players' actions.

newlyDeducedCards: []
reasoning: >
  Based on the events of this turn, Green Agent made a suggestion of Mrs. White, Candlestick, Kitchen. Red Agent showed a card to Green Agent. Since I did not see the card shown by Red Agent, and I already knew Kitchen was eliminated (it's in my hand), I cannot definitively deduce any new cards as eliminated from the solution based solely on this interaction. The card shown by Red Agent could have been Mrs. White or Candlestick.
memorySummary: >
  My current knowledge of eliminated cards includes those in my hand (Dining Room, Billiard Room, Conservatory) and those I've definitively deduced or seen shown (Dagger, Miss Scarlet, Colonel Mustard, Mrs. Peacock, Professor Plum, Mr. Green, Kitchen).

  Key insights from the game history:
  - Professor Plum is confirmed to be held by Yellow Agent.
  - Candlestick continues to be a frequently suggested weapon by multiple players (Purple, Blue, Yellow), but its location remains uncertain.
  - Blue previously showed a card for a Mrs. Peacock/Candlestick/Study suggestion.
  - Yellow has shown cards for Candlestick suggestions multiple times.
  - Blue's recent suggestion involving Mrs. White is notable as this suspect appears less frequently in suggestions.
  - Players continue to strategically use known eliminated cards in their suggestions.
  - Blue's suggestion of Conservatory (which I had to show) likely indicates they were trying to identify card holders.

  Uncertainties:
  - The location of the Candlestick is still unknown despite its frequent appearance in suggestions.
  - Mrs. White's status (whether she is in the solution or held by a player) remains unclear.
  - The location of the Study is still uncertain despite previous suggestions.
  - The card shown by Red Agent to Green Agent in the most recent turn is unknown.

  My next steps are to continue monitoring suggestions, particularly those involving the Candlestick and Mrs. White, and observe which cards are shown in response to gain further information.

You are Purple Agent. Analyze the events from your last turn (Turn 9) and update your memory and deductions.

WHAT IS A DEDUCTION:
A deduction is a card that you can definitively conclude is NOT part of the murder solution. Deduce cards when:
1. It's in your hand.
2. Another player shows it to you.
3. You can logically prove it must be held by a specific player or eliminated.

Events from THIS turn:
I suggested: Professor Plum, Candlestick, Lounge.

Latest turn analysis: - Yellow suggested Professor Plum, Lead Pipe, Hall - I showed Lead Pipe to Yellow - No new deductions possible from this interaction
Remaining uncertainties: - Still cannot determine if Blue holds Candlestick - Professor Plum's location unknown - Many other cards' locations still unknown

You are Yellow Agent. Analyze the events from your last turn (Turn 7) and update your memory and deductions.

WHAT IS A DEDUCTION:
A deduction is a card that you can definitively conclude is NOT part of the murder solution. Deduce cards when:
1. It's in your hand.
2. Another player shows it to you.
3. You can logically prove it must be held by a specific player or eliminated.

Your current knowledge:
Cards in my hand: Revolver, Kitchen, Library
Known Eliminated Cards: Study, Dagger, Kitchen, Candlestick, Mrs. Peacock
Your most recent memory note:
Current eliminated cards: Revolver, Kitchen, Library (in my hand), Study, Dagger, Candlestick (deduced). From Turn 1, Blue Agent showed either Professor Plum or Candlestick to Red Agent in response to Professor Plum, Candlestick, Study suggestion - now we know it was specifically Candlestick. From Turn 3, when Blue Agent suggested Miss Scarlet, Dagger, Lounge, Green Agent showed either Miss Scarlet or Lounge (since Dagger was eliminated). In Turn 5, I showed Kitchen to Green Agent who suggested Miss Scarlet, Candlestick, Kitchen. Notable insight: The repeated appearance of Candlestick in suggestions, combined with Turn 1's interaction, allowed us to definitively deduce it was shown in Turn 1. Still cannot determine whether Miss Scarlet or Lounge was shown in Turn 3's interaction.

Events from THIS turn:
I suggested: Mrs. Peacock, Lead Pipe, Conservatory.
Purple Agent showed me the card: Mrs. Peacock.

Do not re-list cards from your hand or other pre-existing knowledge if their status as a deduction was already established *before* this turn's events.

Remember: A deduction must be 100% certain.

A deduction is a card that you can definitively conclude is NOT part of the murder solution. Deduce cards when:
1. It's in your hand.
2. Another player shows it to you.
3. You can logically prove it must be held by a specific player or eliminated.

  - Wrench
reasoning: Blue Agent showed me the Wrench card, confirming its elimination.
memorySummary: My understanding of the game state has been updated. I now know that the Wrench is not the murder weapon, as Blue Agent revealed it. This adds to the previously eliminated cards: Lead Pipe, Conservatory, Professor Plum, Mrs. White, Candlestick, and Billiard Room. My cards remain the same: Dining Room, Ballroom, and Conservatory. I suspect the murder room to be one of the remaining unconfirmed rooms: Kitchen, Hall, Lounge, or Library. Colonel Mustard continues to be suggested but remains unconfirmed. Orange likely holds at least one of the following: Colonel Mustard, Kitchen, or Revolver, based on their suggestions and my showing of the Ballroom card. Purple holds either Mrs. White or the Revolver, and Green holds the Study.

  - Revolver
reasoning: Based on the fact that Purple holds either Mrs. White or Revolver, and Orange has been confirmed to hold Colonel Mustard, Candlestick, or Kitchen, the only remaining weapon that fits in this scenario is the Revolver.
memorySummary: My current understanding is that the murder took place in one of the remaining unconfirmed rooms (Kitchen, Hall, Lounge, Library). The confirmed eliminated cards are Lead Pipe, Candlestick, Billiard Room, and Professor Plum (from previous deductions), Mrs. White (from Green/Purple interaction), and now Wrench (shown by Blue Agent). The suspected suspects are Miss Scarlet and Mr. Green. The remaining weapons are Rope, Wrench, and Revolver. The Room suggestions have narrowed down to Kitchen, Hall, Lounge, and Library. My investigation priorities remain focused on these rooms, monitoring Colonel Mustard suggestions, and tracking the hands of the remaining suspects and weapons.

reasoning:
Based on the events of Turn 1, I can confidently deduce that the Lead Pipe is not part of the murder solution. Blue Agent explicitly showed me this card, confirming its elimination from the possibilities.

memorySummary:
My current understanding of the game state is as follows:

- **Known Eliminated Cards:** Lead Pipe
- **Cards in Hand:** Dining Room, Ballroom, Conservatory
- **Suspects:** Colonel Mustard (my initial suspicion)
- **Weapons:** None can be definitively deduced yet.
- **Rooms:** Conservatory (my initial suggestion)

I have no further deductions based on the current information, as no additional cards were revealed or discussed during this turn. My focus remains on identifying the remaining suspect, weapon, and room to solve the mystery.

  KEY PATTERNS & INSIGHTS: 
    1. Weapon patterns: - Candlestick appears frequently in suggestions without confirmation - Lead Pipe is eliminated - Other weapons have been suggested less frequently - Wrench just appeared in Red's suggestion
    2. Room patterns: - Several rooms remain unexplored (Study, Conservatory, Ballroom) - Kitchen, Dining Room are eliminated - Hall has been featured in Yellow's recent suggestions
    3. Suspect patterns: - Professor Plum and Mrs. Peacock are eliminated - Miss Scarlet was previously suggested by Green - Colonel Mustard (in my hand) just suggested again by Red
  STRATEGY FOCUS: 
    - Continue monitoring repeated suggestions
    - Watch for players suggesting previously shown cards
    - Pay particular attention to weapon suggestions due to their relative infrequency
    - Track unexplored rooms
    - Note that Red just suggested two known eliminated cards (Kitchen and Colonel Mustard) - this might be significant

A deduction is a card that you can definitively conclude is NOT part of the murder solution. Deduce cards when:
1. It's in your hand.
