Your most recent memory note:
ELIMINATED CARDS: - In my hand: Lounge, Library, Colonel Mustard - Previously confirmed: Kitchen, Mrs. Peacock, Dining Room, Lead Pipe, Professor Plum
KEY PATTERNS & INSIGHTS: 1. Weapon patterns: - Candlestick appears frequently in suggestions without confirmation - Lead Pipe is eliminated - Other weapons have been suggested less frequently - Wrench just appeared in Red's suggestion
2. Room patterns: - Several rooms remain unexplored (Study, Conservatory, Ballroom) - Kitchen, Dining Room are eliminated - Hall has been featured in Yellow's recent suggestions
3. Suspect patterns: - Professor Plum and Mrs. Peacock are eliminated - Miss Scarlet was previously suggested by Green - Colonel Mustard (in my hand) just suggested again by Red
STRATEGY FOCUS: - Continue monitoring repeated suggestions - Watch for players suggesting previously shown cards - Pay particular attention to weapon suggestions due to their relative infrequency - Track unexplored rooms - Note that Red just suggested two known eliminated cards (Kitchen and Colonel Mustard) - this might be significant

Key tracking points: 1. Murder room must be Kitchen, Hall, Lounge, Library, or Study (all others eliminated) 2. Three weapons confirmed not involved: Lead Pipe, Candlestick 3. Colonel Mustard continues to appear in suggestions but remains unconfirmed 4. Study is confirmed in Green's hand (from previous deduction) 5.

From Turn 3, when Blue Agent suggested Miss Scarlet, Dagger, Lounge, Green Agent showed either Miss Scarlet or Lounge (since Dagger was eliminated). In Turn 5, I showed Kitchen to Green Agent who suggested Miss Scarlet, Candlestick, Kitchen.

ELIMINATED CARDS: - In my hand: Dining Room, Billiard Room, Conservatory - Definitively shown/deduced: Miss Scarlet, Colonel Mustard, Mrs. Peacock, Dagger, Professor Plum, Mr. Green
KEY KNOWLEDGE: 1. Professor Plum is confirmed to be held by Yellow Agent 2. Candlestick continues to appear frequently: - Multiple suggestions involving it by Purple and now Blue - Blue previously showed a card for Mrs. Peacock/Candlestick/Study suggestion - Yellow has shown cards for Candlestick suggestions multiple times - Still cannot definitively determine its location 3. Blue's latest suggestion using Mrs. White is notable as one of few suggestions with this suspect
PATTERN ANALYSIS: - Players continue strategic use of known eliminated cards - Blue's suggestion of Conservatory (which I had to show) might indicate they're trying to identify card holders - Candlestick remains a frequently suggested weapon, appearing in suggestions from multiple players
UNCERTAINTIES: - Cannot definitively determine Candlestick's location despite its frequent appearance - Mrs. White's status remains unclear - Study's location still uncertain despite previous suggestions
NEXT STEPS: - Continue monitoring Candlestick-related suggestions and responses - Pay attention to suggestions involving Mrs. White as this suspect appears less frequently

jsonl_line_87,"You are an AI agent playing the board game Cluedo (also known as Clue), a deduction game where players try to determine the suspect, weapon, and room of a crime. Your task is to update your memory and deductions based on new events. Respond ONLY with a YAML object.

Important: For this memory update, do NOT list cards that are already in your hand as 'newlyDeducedCards'. Focus ONLY on cards that you have deduced for the first time based on the game events from *this* turn or by logical inference from other players' actions or revealed cards. Cards from your own hand should already be part of your permanent memory and not re-stated as 'newly deduced' in this update. 

You are Green Agent. Analyze the events from your last turn (Turn 5) and update your memory and deductions.

WHAT IS A DEDUCTION:
A deduction is a card that you can definitively conclude is NOT part of the murder solution. Deduce cards when:
1. It's in your hand.
2. Another player shows it to you.
3. You can logically prove it must be held by a specific player or eliminated.

Respond ONLY with a YAML object in the following format. Provide a DETAILED summary.

Events from THIS turn:
I suggested: Colonel Mustard, Lead Pipe, Hall.
Yellow Agent showed me the card: Hall.

Based ONLY on the information above, what new cards can you definitively deduce are NOT part of the solution?

Important: In your response for `newlyDeducedCards`, list only those cards that became definitively known as 'not part of the solution' *during this specific turn's events*. Do not re-list cards from your hand or other pre-existing knowledge if their status as a deduction was already established *before* this turn's events.

Remember: A deduction must be 100% certain.

newlyDeducedCards:
  - <string> # Card name, or empty list if none
reasoning: <string> # Explain exactly how you deduced each new card
memorySummary: <string> # DETAILED summary of your CURRENT understanding. Include ALL known eliminated cards (hand + deduced), suspicions, and key insights from the game history.

Your current knowledge:
Cards in my hand: Mrs. White, Rope, Mr. Green
Known Eliminated Cards: Candlestick, Hall
Your most recent memory note:
Known eliminated cards: - In my hand: Mrs. White, Rope, Mr. Green - Previously eliminated: Candlestick
Key observations and insights: 1. Orange Agent has at least one of: Colonel Mustard or Billiard Room (from showing a card to Red's earlier suggestion) 2. Red received confirmation of one card from their suggestion (Colonel Mustard, Candlestick, Billiard Room), but I don't know which one 3. Blue Agent now knows Mrs. White is not the solution (since I just showed it)
No additional definitive deductions can be made at this time. The turn events (Blue's suggestion and my showing Mrs. White) only confirmed information I already knew since Mrs. White is in my hand.","[""Hall""]",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
