From Turn 1, Blue Agent showed either Professor Plum or Candlestick to Red Agent in response to Professor Plum, Candlestick, Study suggestion - now we know it was specifically Candlestick. From Turn 3, when Blue Agent suggested Miss Scarlet, Dagger, Lounge, Green Agent showed either Miss Scarlet or Lounge (since Dagger was eliminated). In Turn 5, I showed Kitchen to Green Agent who suggested Miss Scarlet, Candlestick, Kitchen. Notable insight: The repeated appearance of Candlestick in suggestions, combined with Turn 1's interaction, allowed us to definitively deduce it was shown in Turn 1. Still cannot determine whether Miss Scarlet or Lounge was shown in Turn 3's interaction.\n\nEvents from THIS turn:\nI suggested: Mrs. Peacock, Lead Pipe, Conservatory.\nPurple Agent showed me the card: Mrs. Peacock.\n\nBased ONLY on the information above, what new cards can you definitively deduce are NOT part of the solution?\n\nImportant: In your response for `newlyDeducedCards`, list only those cards that became definitively known as 'not part of the solution' *during this specific turn's events*.
