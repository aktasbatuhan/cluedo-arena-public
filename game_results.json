The suggestion avoids using any of my known cards (Candlestick, Ballroom, Dining Room) to maximize information gain."

With the solution cards remaining unclear and the risk of elimination if wrong, it's too early to make an accusation. I should continue gathering information through suggestions and monitoring other players' interactions."
