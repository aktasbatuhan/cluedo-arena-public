Since no one could disprove this suggestion, I can definitively deduce that Professor Plum and Lead Pipe are not part of the murder solution. Hall was already known to be eliminated. My current understanding is that the solution must consist of cards not in my hand and not eliminated. I have no suspicions about specific players holding certain cards at this point, but I will continue to gather information and make deductions based on future turns.\n\nEvents from THIS turn:\nBlue Agent suggested: Professor Plum, Wrench, Study.\nNo one could disprove Blue Agent's suggestion.\n\nBased ONLY on the information above, what new cards can you definitively deduce are NOT part of the solution?\nRemember: A deduction must be 100% certain.\n\nRespond ONLY with a YAML object in the following format.
