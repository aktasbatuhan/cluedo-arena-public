No other cards have been definitively deduced or eliminated. My current understanding is that the solution excludes the aforementioned cards, and no new deductions can be made based on the available information. I have no strong suspicions about any specific cards being part of the solution.\n\nPrevious Turn Summary:\nTurn 1: Red Agent suggested Mrs. White, Candlestick, Library. Orange Agent showed a card.\nTurn 3: Blue Agent suggested Mrs. White, Candlestick, Library. Orange Agent showed a card.\nTurn 5: Green Agent suggested Mrs. White, Candlestick, Study. Purple Agent showed a card.\nTurn 7: Yellow Agent suggested Mrs. Peacock, Rope, Conservatory. Purple Agent showed a card.\n\nCurrent Turn Events (Turn 7):\nThis turn, you suggested: Mrs. Peacock, Rope, Conservatory.\nResult: Purple Agent showed you the card: Rope.\n\nIMPORTANT CLUEDO LOGIC:\n1. If a suggestion is made and NO PLAYER can challenge it (show any cards), this is strong evidence that ALL THREE suggested cards might be in the solution.\n2. If a suggestion is made and is challenged, at least ONE of the suggested cards is NOT in the solution.\n3. Through elimination: If you can identify all but one card of a category (e.g., 5 of 6 suspects), the remaining one MUST be the solution.\n4. You can win by making a correct accusation even without 100% certainty - reasonable deduction based on probabilities is valid.\n\nYou should consider making an accusation when:\n- You have strong evidence for all three components (suspect, weapon, room)\n- A suggestion including certain cards was not challenged by any player\n- Through the process of elimination, you've narrowed down possibilities significantly\n- The potential reward of winning outweighs the risk of being wrong\n\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in the following format.\nIf shouldAccuse is true, provide your deduced solution.\nIf shouldAccuse is false, provide null for accusation components.\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT use markdown code blocks (```json) in your response - just return the JSON object directly.\n\n{\n  \"shouldAccuse\": boolean,\n  \"accusation\": {\n    \"suspect\": \"string | null (your deduced suspect or null)\",\n    \"weapon\": \"string | null (your deduced weapon or null)\",\n    \"room\": \"string | null (your deduced room or null)\"\n  },\n  \"reasoning\": \"string (explain your decision and reasoning)\"\n}",

Additionally, Library, Study, Rope, Revolver, and Mrs. White are also eliminated. Library was shown by Orange Agent, Study was deduced from Green Agent's suggestion, Rope was previously eliminated, Revolver was shown to me by Yellow Agent, and Mrs. White was shown to Purple Agent and later deduced from Purple Agent's suggestion. I recently showed Mrs. Peacock to Orange Agent, confirming it is not part of the solution. My suggestion of Miss Scarlet, Revolver, and Library did not lead to an accusation, but Yellow Agent showing me the Revolver card allowed me to deduce it is not part of the solution.

Yellow Agent showed a card.\n\nCurrent Turn Events (Turn 13):\nThis turn, you suggested: Miss Scarlet, Revolver, Library.\nResult: Yellow Agent showed you the card: Revolver.\n\nIMPORTANT CLUEDO LOGIC:\n1. If a suggestion is made and NO PLAYER can challenge it (show any cards), this is strong evidence that ALL THREE suggested cards might be in the solution.\n2. If a suggestion is made and is challenged, at least ONE of the suggested cards is NOT in the solution.\n3. Through elimination: If you can identify all but one card of a category (e.g., 5 of 6 suspects), the remaining one MUST be the solution.\n4. You can win by making a correct accusation even without 100% certainty - reasonable deduction based on probabilities is valid.\n\nYou should consider making an accusation when:\n- You have strong evidence for all three components (suspect, weapon, room)\n- A suggestion including certain cards was not challenged by any player\n- Through the process of elimination, you've narrowed down possibilities significantly\n- The potential reward of winning outweighs the risk of being wrong\n\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in the following format.\nIf shouldAccuse is true, provide your deduced solution.\nIf shouldAccuse is false, provide null for accusation components.\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT use markdown code blocks (```json) in your response - just return the JSON object directly.\n\n{\n  \"shouldAccuse\": boolean,\n  \"accusation\": {\n    \"suspect\": \"string | null (your deduced suspect or null)\",\n    \"weapon\": \"string | null (your deduced weapon or null)\",\n    \"room\": \"string | null (your deduced room or null)\"\n  },\n  \"reasoning\": \"string (explain your decision and reasoning)\"\n}",

Orange Agent showing the Library card further confirms its elimination. Key insights: Red Agent's suggestion of Mrs. White, Candlestick, and Library was partially disproven by Orange Agent showing the Library card.

Orange Agent showed a card.\n\nCurrent Turn Events (Turn 15):\nThis turn, you suggested: Miss Scarlet, Candlestick, Library.\nResult: Orange Agent showed you the card: Library.\n\nIMPORTANT CLUEDO LOGIC:\n1. If a suggestion is made and NO PLAYER can challenge it (show any cards), this is strong evidence that ALL THREE suggested cards might be in the solution.\n2. If a suggestion is made and is challenged, at least ONE of the suggested cards is NOT in the solution.\n3. Through elimination: If you can identify all but one card of a category (e.g., 5 of 6 suspects), the remaining one MUST be the solution.\n4. You can win by making a correct accusation even without 100% certainty - reasonable deduction based on probabilities is valid.\n\nYou should consider making an accusation when:\n- You have strong evidence for all three components (suspect, weapon, room)\n- A suggestion including certain cards was not challenged by any player\n- Through the process of elimination, you've narrowed down possibilities significantly\n- The potential reward of winning outweighs the risk of being wrong\n\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in the following format.\nIf shouldAccuse is true, provide your deduced solution.\nIf shouldAccuse is false, provide null for accusation components.\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT use markdown code blocks (```json) in your response - just return the JSON object directly.\n\n{\n  \"shouldAccuse\": boolean,\n  \"accusation\": {\n    \"suspect\": \"string | null (your deduced suspect or null)\",\n    \"weapon\": \"string | null (your deduced weapon or null)\",\n    \"room\": \"string | null (your deduced room or null)\"\n  },\n  \"reasoning\": \"string (explain your decision and reasoning)\"\n}",

Eliminated cards: Library, Study, Rope, Mrs. White, Mrs. Peacock, Revolver. Deduced cards: Study, Mrs. Peacock, Rope, (newly added) Study. Key insights: My hand cards (Dagger, Conservatory, Lead Pipe) and Study are eliminated from the solution. Library is confirmed eliminated based on Orange Agent's action. Mrs. White, Revolver, Mrs. Peacock, and Rope are also eliminated based on previous information. Purple Agent showing me the Study card confirms it is not part of the solution.

Purple Agent showed a card.\n\nCurrent Turn Events (Turn 17):\nThis turn, you suggested: Miss Scarlet, Candlestick, Study.\nResult: Purple Agent showed you the card: Study.\n\nIMPORTANT CLUEDO LOGIC:\n1. If a suggestion is made and NO PLAYER can challenge it (show any cards), this is strong evidence that ALL THREE suggested cards might be in the solution.\n2. If a suggestion is made and is challenged, at least ONE of the suggested cards is NOT in the solution.\n3. Through elimination: If you can identify all but one card of a category (e.g., 5 of 6 suspects), the remaining one MUST be the solution.\n4. You can win by making a correct accusation even without 100% certainty - reasonable deduction based on probabilities is valid.\n\nYou should consider making an accusation when:\n- You have strong evidence for all three components (suspect, weapon, room)\n- A suggestion including certain cards was not challenged by any player\n- Through the process of elimination, you've narrowed down possibilities significantly\n- The potential reward of winning outweighs the risk of being wrong\n\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in the following format.\nIf shouldAccuse is true, provide your deduced solution.\nIf shouldAccuse is false, provide null for accusation components.\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT use markdown code blocks (```json) in your response - just return the JSON object directly.\n\n{\n  \"shouldAccuse\": boolean,\n  \"accusation\": {\n    \"suspect\": \"string | null (your deduced suspect or null)\",\n    \"weapon\": \"string | null (your deduced weapon or null)\",\n    \"room\": \"string | null (your deduced room or null)\"\n  },\n  \"reasoning\": \"string (explain your decision and reasoning)\"\n}",

Key insights: Red Agent's suggestion was partially disproven by Orange Agent showing the Library card. Purple Agent's suggestion further eliminated Dining Room. Green Agent's suggestion did not provide new eliminations."

If a suggestion is made and is challenged, at least ONE of the suggested cards is NOT in the solution.\n3. Through elimination: If you can identify all but one card of a category (e.g., 5 of 6 suspects), the remaining one MUST be the solution.\n4.

If a suggestion is made and NO PLAYER can challenge it (show any cards), this is strong evidence that ALL THREE suggested cards might be in the solution.\n2. If a suggestion is made and is challenged, at least ONE of the suggested cards is NOT in the solution.\n3. Through elimination: If you can identify all but one card of a category (e.g., 5 of 6 suspects), the remaining one MUST be the solution.\n4. You can win by making a correct accusation even without 100% certainty - reasonable deduction based on probabilities is valid.\n\nYou should consider making an accusation when:\n- You have strong evidence for all three components (suspect, weapon, room)\n- A suggestion including certain cards was not challenged by any player\n- Through the process of elimination, you've narrowed down possibilities significantly\n- The potential reward of winning outweighs the risk of being wrong\n\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in the following format.\nIf shouldAccuse is true, provide your deduced solution.\nIf shouldAccuse is false, provide null for accusation components.\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT use markdown code blocks (```json) in your response - just return the JSON object directly.\n\n{\n  \"shouldAccuse\": boolean,\n  \"accusation\": {\n    \"suspect\": \"string | null (your deduced suspect or null)\",\n    \"weapon\": \"string | null (your deduced weapon or null)\",\n    \"room\": \"string | null (your deduced room or null)\"\n  },\n  \"reasoning\": \"string (explain your decision and reasoning)\"\n}",

If a suggestion is made and NO PLAYER can challenge it (show any cards), this is strong evidence that ALL THREE suggested cards might be in the solution.\n2. If a suggestion is made and is challenged, at least ONE of the suggested cards is NOT in the solution.\n3. Through elimination: If you can identify all but one card of a category (e.g., 5 of 6 suspects), the remaining one MUST be the solution.\n4. You can win by making a correct accusation even without 100% certainty - reasonable deduction based on probabilities is valid.\n\nYou should consider making an accusation when:\n- You have strong evidence for all three components (suspect, weapon, room)\n- A suggestion including certain cards was not challenged by any player\n- Through the process of elimination, you've narrowed down possibilities significantly\n- The potential reward of winning outweighs the risk of being wrong\n\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in the following format.\nIf shouldAccuse is true, provide your deduced solution.\nIf shouldAccuse is false, provide null for accusation components.\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT use markdown code blocks (```json) in your response - just return the JSON object directly.\n\n{\n  \"shouldAccuse\": boolean,\n  \"accusation\": {\n    \"suspect\": \"string | null (your deduced suspect or null)\",\n    \"weapon\": \"string | null (your deduced weapon or null)\",\n    \"room\": \"string | null (your deduced room or null)\"\n  },\n  \"reasoning\": \"string (explain your decision and reasoning)\"\n}",

My suggestion of Mr. Green, Candlestick, and Conservatory was not disproven, but no new deductions can be made from this. No other cards have been definitively deduced or eliminated. I have no strong suspicions about any specific cards being part of the solution. The current understanding is that the solution excludes the aforementioned cards, and no new insights have been gained from the last turn.\n\nPrevious Turn Summary:\nTurn 1: Red Agent suggested Mrs. White, Candlestick, Library. Orange Agent showed a card.\nTurn 3: Blue Agent suggested Mrs. White, Candlestick, Library. Orange Agent showed a card.\nTurn 5: Green Agent suggested Mrs. White, Candlestick, Study. Purple Agent showed a card.\nTurn 7: Yellow Agent suggested Mrs. Peacock, Rope, Conservatory. Purple Agent showed a card.\nTurn 9: Purple Agent suggested Mrs. White, Candlestick, Dining Room. Red Agent showed a card.\nTurn 11: Orange Agent suggested Mrs. Peacock, Rope, Conservatory. Red Agent showed a card.\nTurn 13: Red Agent suggested Miss Scarlet, Revolver, Library. Yellow Agent showed a card.\nTurn 15: Blue Agent suggested Miss Scarlet, Candlestick, Library. Orange Agent showed a card.\nTurn 17: Green Agent suggested Miss Scarlet, Candlestick, Study. Purple Agent showed a card.\nTurn 19: Yellow Agent suggested Miss Scarlet, Candlestick, Conservatory. Orange Agent showed a card.\nTurn 21: Purple Agent suggested Colonel Mustard, Candlestick, Dining Room.

Green Agent showed a card.\nTurn 27: Blue Agent suggested Mr. Green, Candlestick, Library. Orange Agent showed a card.\nTurn 29: Green Agent suggested Mr. Green, Candlestick, Study. No challenge.\nTurn 31: Yellow Agent suggested Mr. Green, Candlestick, Conservatory. No challenge.\n\nCurrent Turn Events (Turn 31):\nThis turn, you suggested: Mr. Green, Candlestick, Conservatory.\nResult: NO ONE could challenge your suggestion.\n\nIMPORTANT CLUEDO LOGIC:\n1. If a suggestion is made and NO PLAYER can challenge it (show any cards), this is strong evidence that ALL THREE suggested cards might be in the solution.\n2. If a suggestion is made and is challenged, at least ONE of the suggested cards is NOT in the solution.\n3. Through elimination: If you can identify all but one card of a category (e.g., 5 of 6 suspects), the remaining one MUST be the solution.\n4. You can win by making a correct accusation even without 100% certainty - reasonable deduction based on probabilities is valid.\n\nYou should consider making an accusation when:\n- You have strong evidence for all three components (suspect, weapon, room)\n- A suggestion including certain cards was not challenged by any player\n- Through the process of elimination, you've narrowed down possibilities significantly\n- The potential reward of winning outweighs the risk of being wrong\n\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in the following format.\nIf shouldAccuse is true, provide your deduced solution.\nIf shouldAccuse is false, provide null for accusation components.\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT use markdown code blocks (```json) in your response - just return the JSON object directly.\n\n{\n  \"shouldAccuse\": boolean,\n  \"accusation\": {\n    \"suspect\": \"string | null (your deduced suspect or null)\",\n    \"weapon\": \"string | null (your deduced weapon or null)\",\n    \"room\": \"string | null (your deduced room or null)\"\n  },\n  \"reasoning\": \"string (explain your decision and reasoning)\"\n}",

I have no strong suspicions or additional insights at this point, as the game is still in its early stages.\n\nPrevious Turn Summary:\nTurn 1: Red Agent suggested Miss Scarlet, Revolver, Lounge. No challenge.\n\nCurrent Turn Events (Turn 1):\nThis turn, you suggested: Miss Scarlet, Revolver, Lounge.\nResult: NO ONE could challenge your suggestion.\n\nIMPORTANT CLUEDO LOGIC:\n1. If a suggestion is made and NO PLAYER can challenge it (show any cards), this is strong evidence that ALL THREE suggested cards might be in the solution.\n2. If a suggestion is made and is challenged, at least ONE of the suggested cards is NOT in the solution.\n3. Through elimination: If you can identify all but one card of a category (e.g., 5 of 6 suspects), the remaining one MUST be the solution.\n4. You can win by making a correct accusation even without 100% certainty - reasonable deduction based on probabilities is valid.\n\nYou should consider making an accusation when:\n- You have strong evidence for all three components (suspect, weapon, room)\n- A suggestion including certain cards was not challenged by any player\n- Through the process of elimination, you've narrowed down possibilities significantly\n- The potential reward of winning outweighs the risk of being wrong\n\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in the following format.\nIf shouldAccuse is true, provide your deduced solution.\nIf shouldAccuse is false, provide null for accusation components.\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT use markdown code blocks (```json) in your response - just return the JSON object directly.\n\n{\n  \"shouldAccuse\": boolean,\n  \"accusation\": {\n    \"suspect\": \"string | null (your deduced suspect or null)\",\n    \"weapon\": \"string | null (your deduced weapon or null)\",\n    \"room\": \"string | null (your deduced room or null)\"\n  },\n  \"reasoning\": \"string (explain your decision and reasoning)\"\n}",

Red Agent suggested Miss Scarlet, Revolver, and Lounge, but this suggestion remains unverified, except for Revolver which is now deduced. Blue Agent suggested Miss Scarlet, Revolver, and Conservatory, with Conservatory and Revolver now eliminated. Green Agent suggested Miss Scarlet, Revolver, and Library, with Library and Revolver being deduced as eliminated. My understanding of the game state includes the cards in my hand (Conservatory, Candlestick, Ballroom), the deduced cards (Conservatory, Library, Revolver), and the unverified suggestions from Red, Blue, and Green Agents.\n\nPrevious Turn Summary:\nTurn 1: Red Agent suggested Miss Scarlet, Revolver, Lounge. No challenge.\nTurn 3: Blue Agent suggested Miss Scarlet, Revolver, Conservatory. Yellow Agent showed a card.\nTurn 5: Green Agent suggested Miss Scarlet, Revolver, Library. Orange Agent showed a card.\nTurn 7: Yellow Agent suggested Miss Scarlet, Revolver, Hall. Red Agent showed a card.\n\nCurrent Turn Events (Turn 7):\nThis turn, you suggested: Miss Scarlet, Revolver, Hall.\nResult: Red Agent showed you the card: Revolver.\n\nIMPORTANT CLUEDO LOGIC:\n1. If a suggestion is made and NO PLAYER can challenge it (show any cards), this is strong evidence that ALL THREE suggested cards might be in the solution.\n2. If a suggestion is made and is challenged, at least ONE of the suggested cards is NOT in the solution.\n3. Through elimination: If you can identify all but one card of a category (e.g., 5 of 6 suspects), the remaining one MUST be the solution.\n4. You can win by making a correct accusation even without 100% certainty - reasonable deduction based on probabilities is valid.\n\nYou should consider making an accusation when:\n- You have strong evidence for all three components (suspect, weapon, room)\n- A suggestion including certain cards was not challenged by any player\n- Through the process of elimination, you've narrowed down possibilities significantly\n- The potential reward of winning outweighs the risk of being wrong\n\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in the following format.\nIf shouldAccuse is true, provide your deduced solution.\nIf shouldAccuse is false, provide null for accusation components.\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT use markdown code blocks (```json) in your response - just return the JSON object directly.\n\n{\n  \"shouldAccuse\": boolean,\n  \"accusation\": {\n    \"suspect\": \"string | null (your deduced suspect or null)\",\n    \"weapon\": \"string | null (your deduced weapon or null)\",\n    \"room\": \"string | null (your deduced room or null)\"\n  },\n  \"reasoning\": \"string (explain your decision and reasoning)\"\n}",

The Library card is also deduced as eliminated because I showed it to Green Agent, proving it cannot be part of the solution. The Revolver card is deduced as eliminated because it was previously shown by Green Agent and confirmed not to be part of the solution. No other cards have been deduced as eliminated from the solution based on game events. Green Agent's suggestion of Miss Scarlet, Revolver, and Library is partially verified, with Library and Revolver eliminated. Red Agent's previous suggestion of Miss Scarlet, Revolver, and Lounge remains unverified. Yellow Agent's suggestion of Miss Scarlet, Revolver, and Hall does not provide new deductions. Purple Agent's suggestion of Miss Scarlet, Revolver, Study does not provide new deductions. No strong suspicions or additional insights can be derived beyond the eliminated cards.\nRecent Turn History:\nTurn 1: Red Agent suggested Miss Scarlet, Revolver, Lounge.

Orange Agent showed a card.\nTurn 7: Yellow Agent suggested Miss Scarlet, Revolver, Hall. Red Agent showed a card.\nTurn 9: Purple Agent suggested Miss Scarlet, Revolver, Study. Red Agent showed a card.\n\nMake a strategic suggestion considering:\n1. Your known cards and deductions.\n2. Previous suggestions and their outcomes (from Turn History).\n3.

If a suggestion is made and NO PLAYER can challenge it (show any cards), this is strong evidence that ALL THREE suggested cards might be in the solution.\n2. If a suggestion is made and is challenged, at least ONE of the suggested cards is NOT in the solution.\n3. Through elimination: If you can identify all but one card of a category (e.g., 5 of 6 suspects), the remaining one MUST be the solution.\n4. You can win by making a correct accusation even without 100% certainty - reasonable deduction based on probabilities is valid.\n\nYou should consider making an accusation when:\n- You have strong evidence for all three components (suspect, weapon, room)\n- A suggestion including certain cards was not challenged by any player\n- Through the process of elimination, you've narrowed down possibilities significantly\n- The potential reward of winning outweighs the risk of being wrong\n\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in the following format.\nIf shouldAccuse is true, provide your deduced solution.\nIf shouldAccuse is false, provide null for accusation components.\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT use markdown code blocks (```json) in your response - just return the JSON object directly.\n\n{\n  \"shouldAccuse\": boolean,\n  \"accusation\": {\n    \"suspect\": \"string | null (your deduced suspect or null)\",\n    \"weapon\": \"string | null (your deduced weapon or null)\",\n    \"room\": \"string | null (your deduced room or null)\"\n  },\n  \"reasoning\": \"string (explain your decision and reasoning)\"\n}",

Previously, I have deduced that Conservatory, Library, and Revolver are not part of the solution based on Blue Agent's suggestion, Yellow Agent's action, and Green Agent's suggestion being disproven by Orange Agent. From the last turn, I showed Purple Agent the Revolver card, and this turn, I showed Orange Agent the Miss Scarlet card, confirming both are not part of the solution. Additionally, Mrs. White is now eliminated based on Blue Agent showing it to me this turn. Eliminated cards: Miss Scarlet, Revolver, Colonel Mustard, Conservatory, Library, Mrs. White.

If a suggestion is made and NO PLAYER can challenge it (show any cards), this is strong evidence that ALL THREE suggested cards might be in the solution.\n2. If a suggestion is made and is challenged, at least ONE of the suggested cards is NOT in the solution.\n3. Through elimination: If you can identify all but one card of a category (e.g., 5 of 6 suspects), the remaining one MUST be the solution.\n4. You can win by making a correct accusation even without 100% certainty - reasonable deduction based on probabilities is valid.\n\nYou should consider making an accusation when:\n- You have strong evidence for all three components (suspect, weapon, room)\n- A suggestion including certain cards was not challenged by any player\n- Through the process of elimination, you've narrowed down possibilities significantly\n- The potential reward of winning outweighs the risk of being wrong\n\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in the following format.\nIf shouldAccuse is true, provide your deduced solution.\nIf shouldAccuse is false, provide null for accusation components.\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT use markdown code blocks (```json) in your response - just return the JSON object directly.\n\n{\n  \"shouldAccuse\": boolean,\n  \"accusation\": {\n    \"suspect\": \"string | null (your deduced suspect or null)\",\n    \"weapon\": \"string | null (your deduced weapon or null)\",\n    \"room\": \"string | null (your deduced room or null)\"\n  },\n  \"reasoning\": \"string (explain your decision and reasoning)\"\n}",

If a suggestion is made and NO PLAYER can challenge it (show any cards), this is strong evidence that ALL THREE suggested cards might be in the solution.\n2. If a suggestion is made and is challenged, at least ONE of the suggested cards is NOT in the solution.\n3. Through elimination: If you can identify all but one card of a category (e.g., 5 of 6 suspects), the remaining one MUST be the solution.\n4. You can win by making a correct accusation even without 100% certainty - reasonable deduction based on probabilities is valid.\n\nYou should consider making an accusation when:\n- You have strong evidence for all three components (suspect, weapon, room)\n- A suggestion including certain cards was not challenged by any player\n- Through the process of elimination, you've narrowed down possibilities significantly\n- The potential reward of winning outweighs the risk of being wrong\n\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in the following format.\nIf shouldAccuse is true, provide your deduced solution.\nIf shouldAccuse is false, provide null for accusation components.\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT use markdown code blocks (```json) in your response - just return the JSON object directly.\n\n{\n  \"shouldAccuse\": boolean,\n  \"accusation\": {\n    \"suspect\": \"string | null (your deduced suspect or null)\",\n    \"weapon\": \"string | null (your deduced weapon or null)\",\n    \"room\": \"string | null (your deduced room or null)\"\n  },\n  \"reasoning\": \"string (explain your decision and reasoning)\"\n}",

If a suggestion is made and is challenged, at least ONE of the suggested cards is NOT in the solution.\n3. Through elimination: If you can identify all but one card of a category (e.g., 5 of 6 suspects), the remaining one MUST be the solution.\n4. You can win by making a correct accusation even without 100% certainty - reasonable deduction based on probabilities is valid.\n\nYou should consider making an accusation when:\n- You have strong evidence for all three components (suspect, weapon, room)\n- A suggestion including certain cards was not challenged by any player\n- Through the process of elimination, you've narrowed down possibilities significantly\n- The potential reward of winning outweighs the risk of being wrong\n\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in the following format.\nIf shouldAccuse is true, provide your deduced solution.\nIf shouldAccuse is false, provide null for accusation components.\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT use markdown code blocks (```json) in your response - just return the JSON object directly.\n\n{\n  \"shouldAccuse\": boolean,\n  \"accusation\": {\n    \"suspect\": \"string | null (your deduced suspect or null)\",\n    \"weapon\": \"string | null (your deduced weapon or null)\",\n    \"room\": \"string | null (your deduced room or null)\"\n  },\n  \"reasoning\": \"string (explain your decision and reasoning)\"\n}",

No new strong suspicions can be derived from the limited information available. The game state reflects these eliminations, with no additional cards definitively eliminated beyond what is listed.\n\nPrevious Turn Summary:\nTurn 1: Red Agent suggested Miss Scarlet, Revolver, Lounge.

Green Agent showed a card.\n\nCurrent Turn Events (Turn 21):\nThis turn, you suggested: Mr. Green, Dagger, Study.\nResult: Green Agent showed you the card: Study.\n\nIMPORTANT CLUEDO LOGIC:\n1. If a suggestion is made and NO PLAYER can challenge it (show any cards), this is strong evidence that ALL THREE suggested cards might be in the solution.\n2. If a suggestion is made and is challenged, at least ONE of the suggested cards is NOT in the solution.\n3. Through elimination: If you can identify all but one card of a category (e.g., 5 of 6 suspects), the remaining one MUST be the solution.\n4. You can win by making a correct accusation even without 100% certainty - reasonable deduction based on probabilities is valid.\n\nYou should consider making an accusation when:\n- You have strong evidence for all three components (suspect, weapon, room)\n- A suggestion including certain cards was not challenged by any player\n- Through the process of elimination, you've narrowed down possibilities significantly\n- The potential reward of winning outweighs the risk of being wrong\n\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in the following format.\nIf shouldAccuse is true, provide your deduced solution.\nIf shouldAccuse is false, provide null for accusation components.\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT use markdown code blocks (```json) in your response - just return the JSON object directly.\n\n{\n  \"shouldAccuse\": boolean,\n  \"accusation\": {\n    \"suspect\": \"string | null (your deduced suspect or null)\",\n    \"weapon\": \"string | null (your deduced weapon or null)\",\n    \"room\": \"string | null (your deduced room or null)\"\n  },\n  \"reasoning\": \"string (explain your decision and reasoning)\"\n}",

Deduced as eliminated are Conservatory, Revolver, Miss Scarlet, Mrs. White, Candlestick, and Library. The Conservatory card is deduced as eliminated because Blue Agent's suggestion of Miss Scarlet, Revolver, Conservatory must contain at least one correct card, and both Miss Scarlet and Revolver are already eliminated. The Library card is deduced as eliminated because I showed it to Green Agent, proving it cannot be part of the solution. The Revolver card is deduced as eliminated because it was previously shown by Green Agent and confirmed not to be part of the solution. The Miss Scarlet card is deduced as eliminated because Red Agent showed it to me, proving it cannot be part of the solution. The Mrs. White card is deduced as eliminated because it was previously shown by Red Agent and confirmed not to be part of the solution. The Candlestick card is deduced as eliminated based on Green Agent's suggestion being disproven. No other cards have been deduced as eliminated from the solution based on game events. My suggestion of Miss Scarlet, Candlestick, Lounge is partially verified with Miss Scarlet, Candlestick, and Conservatory eliminated. Red Agent's previous suggestion of Miss Scarlet, Revolver, and Lounge remains unverified, but Miss Scarlet, Revolver, and Conservatory are now eliminated. Yellow Agent's suggestion of Mr. Green, Dagger, Hall does not provide new deductions.

Deduced as eliminated are Conservatory, Revolver, Miss Scarlet, Mrs. White, Candlestick, Library, and Dagger. The Conservatory card is deduced as eliminated because Blue Agent's suggestion of Miss Scarlet, Revolver, Conservatory must contain at least one correct card, and both Miss Scarlet and Revolver are already eliminated. The Library card is deduced as eliminated because I showed it to Green Agent, proving it cannot be part of the solution. The Revolver card is deduced as eliminated because it was previously shown by Green Agent and confirmed not to be part of the solution. The Miss Scarlet card is deduced as eliminated because Red Agent showed it to me, proving it cannot be part of the solution. The Mrs. White card is deduced as eliminated because it was previously shown by Red Agent and confirmed not to be part of the solution. The Candlestick card is deduced as eliminated based on Green Agent's suggestion being disproven. The Dagger card is deduced as eliminated because Purple Agent showed it to me, proving it cannot be part of the solution. My suggestion of Miss Scarlet, Candlestick, Lounge is partially verified with Miss Scarlet, Candlestick, and Conservatory eliminated. My recent suggestion of Mr. Green, Dagger, Lounge is partially verified with Dagger eliminated. Red Agent's previous suggestion of Miss Scarlet, Revolver, and Lounge remains unverified, but Miss Scarlet, Revolver, and Conservatory are now eliminated. Yellow Agent's suggestion of Mr. Green, Dagger, Hall is partially verified with Dagger eliminated. Purple Agent's suggestion of Mr. Green, Dagger, Study is partially verified with Dagger eliminated. No strong suspicions or additional insights can be derived beyond the eliminated cards.\n\nPrevious Turn Summary:\nTurn 1: Red Agent suggested Miss Scarlet, Revolver, Lounge. No challenge.\nTurn 3: Blue Agent suggested Miss Scarlet, Revolver, Conservatory. Yellow Agent showed a card.\nTurn 5: Green Agent suggested Miss Scarlet, Revolver, Library. Orange Agent showed a card.\nTurn 7: Yellow Agent suggested Miss Scarlet, Revolver, Hall. Red Agent showed a card.\nTurn 9: Purple Agent suggested Miss Scarlet, Revolver, Study. Red Agent showed a card.\nTurn 11: Orange Agent suggested Miss Scarlet, Candlestick, Lounge. Red Agent showed a card.\nTurn 13: Red Agent suggested Mrs. White, Candlestick, Lounge. Blue Agent showed a card.\nTurn 15: Blue Agent suggested Miss Scarlet, Revolver, Conservatory. Yellow Agent showed a card.\nTurn 17: Green Agent suggested Miss Scarlet, Candlestick, Library. Yellow Agent showed a card.\nTurn 19: Yellow Agent suggested Mr. Green, Dagger, Hall. Purple Agent showed a card.\nTurn 21: Purple Agent suggested Mr. Green, Dagger, Study. Green Agent showed a card.\nTurn 23: Orange Agent suggested Mr. Green, Dagger, Lounge. Purple Agent showed a card.\n\nCurrent Turn Events (Turn 23):\nThis turn, you suggested: Mr. Green, Dagger, Lounge.\nResult: Purple Agent showed you the card: Dagger.\n\nIMPORTANT CLUEDO LOGIC:\n1. If a suggestion is made and NO PLAYER can challenge it (show any cards), this is strong evidence that ALL THREE suggested cards might be in the solution.\n2. If a suggestion is made and is challenged, at least ONE of the suggested cards is NOT in the solution.\n3. Through elimination: If you can identify all but one card of a category (e.g., 5 of 6 suspects), the remaining one MUST be the solution.\n4. You can win by making a correct accusation even without 100% certainty - reasonable deduction based on probabilities is valid.\n\nYou should consider making an accusation when:\n- You have strong evidence for all three components (suspect, weapon, room)\n- A suggestion including certain cards was not challenged by any player\n- Through the process of elimination, you've narrowed down possibilities significantly\n- The potential reward of winning outweighs the risk of being wrong\n\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in the following format.\nIf shouldAccuse is true, provide your deduced solution.\nIf shouldAccuse is false, provide null for accusation components.\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT use markdown code blocks (```json) in your response - just return the JSON object directly.\n\n{\n  \"shouldAccuse\": boolean,\n  \"accusation\": {\n    \"suspect\": \"string | null (your deduced suspect or null)\",\n    \"weapon\": \"string | null (your deduced weapon or null)\",\n    \"room\": \"string | null (your deduced room or null)\"\n  },\n  \"reasoning\": \"string (explain your decision and reasoning)\"\n}",

The Revolver card is deduced as eliminated because it was previously shown by Green Agent and confirmed not to be part of the solution. The Miss Scarlet card is deduced as eliminated because Red Agent showed it to me, proving it cannot be part of the solution. The Mrs. White card is deduced as eliminated because it was previously shown by Red Agent and confirmed not to be part of the solution. The Candlestick card is deduced as eliminated based on Green Agent's suggestion being disproven. The Dagger card is deduced as eliminated because Purple Agent showed it to me, proving it cannot be part of the solution. No strong suspicions or additional insights can be derived beyond the eliminated cards. Red Agent's suggestion of Mr. Green, Dagger, Lounge does not provide new information, and Purple Agent's action of showing a card to Red Agent does not reveal any information to me."

Previously, I have deduced that Conservatory, Library, Revolver, Miss Scarlet, Mrs. White, Candlestick, and Dagger are not part of the solution based on Blue Agent's suggestion, Yellow Agent's action, Green Agent's suggestion being disproven by Orange Agent, cards shown to me by other players, and the eliminated cards list. Purple Agent showed me the Dagger card, confirming it is not part of the solution. The game remains in its early stages with no strong suspicions or additional insights emerging from the recent turns. Eliminated cards: Miss Scarlet, Revolver, Colonel Mustard, Conservatory, Library, Mrs. White, Candlestick, Dagger. No new strong suspicions or insights have emerged from the last turn. Further information is needed to make additional deductions.\n\nPrevious Turn Summary:\nTurn 1: Red Agent suggested Miss Scarlet, Revolver, Lounge. No challenge.\nTurn 3: Blue Agent suggested Miss Scarlet, Revolver, Conservatory. Yellow Agent showed a card.\nTurn 5: Green Agent suggested Miss Scarlet, Revolver, Library. Orange Agent showed a card.\nTurn 7: Yellow Agent suggested Miss Scarlet, Revolver, Hall. Red Agent showed a card.\nTurn 9: Purple Agent suggested Miss Scarlet, Revolver, Study. Red Agent showed a card.\nTurn 11: Orange Agent suggested Miss Scarlet, Candlestick, Lounge. Red Agent showed a card.\nTurn 13: Red Agent suggested Mrs. White, Candlestick, Lounge.

Green Agent showed a card.\nTurn 23: Orange Agent suggested Mr. Green, Dagger, Lounge. Purple Agent showed a card.\nTurn 25: Red Agent suggested Mr. Green, Dagger, Lounge. Purple Agent showed a card.\n\nCurrent Turn Events (Turn 25):\nThis turn, you suggested: Mr. Green, Dagger, Lounge.\nResult: Purple Agent showed you the card: Dagger.\n\nIMPORTANT CLUEDO LOGIC:\n1. If a suggestion is made and NO PLAYER can challenge it (show any cards), this is strong evidence that ALL THREE suggested cards might be in the solution.\n2. If a suggestion is made and is challenged, at least ONE of the suggested cards is NOT in the solution.\n3. Through elimination: If you can identify all but one card of a category (e.g., 5 of 6 suspects), the remaining one MUST be the solution.\n4. You can win by making a correct accusation even without 100% certainty - reasonable deduction based on probabilities is valid.\n\nYou should consider making an accusation when:\n- You have strong evidence for all three components (suspect, weapon, room)\n- A suggestion including certain cards was not challenged by any player\n- Through the process of elimination, you've narrowed down possibilities significantly\n- The potential reward of winning outweighs the risk of being wrong\n\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in the following format.\nIf shouldAccuse is true, provide your deduced solution.\nIf shouldAccuse is false, provide null for accusation components.\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT use markdown code blocks (```json) in your response - just return the JSON object directly.\n\n{\n  \"shouldAccuse\": boolean,\n  \"accusation\": {\n    \"suspect\": \"string | null (your deduced suspect or null)\",\n    \"weapon\": \"string | null (your deduced weapon or null)\",\n    \"room\": \"string | null (your deduced room or null)\"\n  },\n  \"reasoning\": \"string (explain your decision and reasoning)\"\n}",

The Library card is deduced as eliminated because I showed it to Green Agent, proving it cannot be part of the solution. The Revolver card is deduced as eliminated because it was previously shown by Green Agent and confirmed not to be part of the solution. The Miss Scarlet card is deduced as eliminated because Red Agent showed it to me, proving it cannot be part of the solution. The Mrs. White card is deduced as eliminated because it was previously shown by Red Agent and confirmed not to be part of the solution. The Candlestick card is deduced as eliminated based on Green Agent's suggestion being disproven. The Dagger card is deduced as eliminated because Purple Agent showed it to me, proving it cannot be part of the solution. No strong suspicions or additional insights can be derived beyond the eliminated cards. Red Agent's suggestion of Mr. Green, Dagger, Lounge does not provide new information, and Purple Agent's action of showing a card to Red Agent does not reveal any information to me. Blue Agent's recent suggestion of Mr. Green, Dagger, Conservatory and Yellow Agent's action of showing a card to Blue Agent do not provide any new deductions."

No challenge.\nTurn 3: Blue Agent suggested Miss Scarlet, Revolver, Conservatory. Yellow Agent showed a card.\nTurn 5: Green Agent suggested Miss Scarlet, Revolver, Library. Orange Agent showed a card.\nTurn 7: Yellow Agent suggested Miss Scarlet, Revolver, Hall. Red Agent showed a card.\nTurn 9: Purple Agent suggested Miss Scarlet, Revolver, Study.

Yellow Agent showed a card.\n\nCurrent Turn Events (Turn 27):\nThis turn, you suggested: Mr. Green, Dagger, Conservatory.\nResult: Yellow Agent showed you the card: Conservatory.\n\nIMPORTANT CLUEDO LOGIC:\n1. If a suggestion is made and NO PLAYER can challenge it (show any cards), this is strong evidence that ALL THREE suggested cards might be in the solution.\n2. If a suggestion is made and is challenged, at least ONE of the suggested cards is NOT in the solution.\n3. Through elimination: If you can identify all but one card of a category (e.g., 5 of 6 suspects), the remaining one MUST be the solution.\n4. You can win by making a correct accusation even without 100% certainty - reasonable deduction based on probabilities is valid.\n\nYou should consider making an accusation when:\n- You have strong evidence for all three components (suspect, weapon, room)\n- A suggestion including certain cards was not challenged by any player\n- Through the process of elimination, you've narrowed down possibilities significantly\n- The potential reward of winning outweighs the risk of being wrong\n\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in the following format.\nIf shouldAccuse is true, provide your deduced solution.\nIf shouldAccuse is false, provide null for accusation components.\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT use markdown code blocks (```json) in your response - just return the JSON object directly.\n\n{\n  \"shouldAccuse\": boolean,\n  \"accusation\": {\n    \"suspect\": \"string | null (your deduced suspect or null)\",\n    \"weapon\": \"string | null (your deduced weapon or null)\",\n    \"room\": \"string | null (your deduced room or null)\"\n  },\n  \"reasoning\": \"string (explain your decision and reasoning)\"\n}",

The Conservatory card is deduced as eliminated because Blue Agent's suggestion of Miss Scarlet, Revolver, Conservatory must contain at least one correct card, and both Miss Scarlet and Revolver are already eliminated. The Library card is deduced as eliminated because I showed it to Green Agent, proving it cannot be part of the solution. The Revolver card is deduced as eliminated because it was previously shown by Green Agent and confirmed not to be part of the solution. The Miss Scarlet card is deduced as eliminated because Red Agent showed it to me, proving it cannot be part of the solution. The Mrs. White card is deduced as eliminated because it was previously shown by Red Agent and confirmed not to be part of the solution. The Candlestick card is deduced as eliminated based on Green Agent's suggestion being disproven. The Dagger card is deduced as eliminated because Purple Agent showed it to me, proving it cannot be part of the solution. No strong suspicions or additional insights can be derived beyond the eliminated cards. Red Agent's suggestion of Mr. Green, Dagger, Lounge does not provide new information, and Purple Agent's action of showing a card to Red Agent does not reveal any information to me. Blue Agent's recent suggestion of Mr. Green, Dagger, Conservatory and Yellow Agent's action of showing a card to Blue Agent do not provide any new deductions. Green Agent's latest suggestion of Mr. Green, Dagger, Library does not add new deductions, and Purple Agent's action of showing a card to Green Agent remains unknown to me."

Deduced cards not part of the solution: Conservatory, Library, Revolver, Mrs. White, Candlestick, Study, Dagger. Yellow Agent confirmed Candlestick is not in the solution by showing it to me. Purple Agent's revelation of the Dagger card confirms it is not part of the solution. Unverified suggestions from Red (Mrs. White, Candlestick, Lounge; Mr. Green, Dagger, Lounge), Blue (private card reveal to Red, Mr. Green, Dagger, Conservatory), Orange (Miss Scarlet, Candlestick, Lounge, Mr. Green, Dagger, Lounge), and previous unverified suggestions from Red (Miss Scarlet, Revolver, Lounge), Blue (Miss Scarlet, Revolver, Conservatory), Yellow (Miss Scarlet, Revolver, Hall), Purple (Miss Scarlet, Revolver, Study) remain unconfirmed. Understanding remains limited to the cards in hand, the deduced Conservatory, Library, Revolver, Mrs. White, Candlestick, Study, Dagger, and the unverified suggestions from all Agents.\n\nPrevious Turn Summary:\nTurn 1: Red Agent suggested Miss Scarlet, Revolver, Lounge. No challenge.\nTurn 3: Blue Agent suggested Miss Scarlet, Revolver, Conservatory. Yellow Agent showed a card.\nTurn 5: Green Agent suggested Miss Scarlet, Revolver, Library. Orange Agent showed a card.\nTurn 7: Yellow Agent suggested Miss Scarlet, Revolver, Hall. Red Agent showed a card.\nTurn 9: Purple Agent suggested Miss Scarlet, Revolver, Study.

Purple Agent showed a card.\n\nCurrent Turn Events (Turn 29):\nThis turn, you suggested: Mr. Green, Dagger, Library.\nResult: Purple Agent showed you the card: Dagger.\n\nIMPORTANT CLUEDO LOGIC:\n1. If a suggestion is made and NO PLAYER can challenge it (show any cards), this is strong evidence that ALL THREE suggested cards might be in the solution.\n2. If a suggestion is made and is challenged, at least ONE of the suggested cards is NOT in the solution.\n3. Through elimination: If you can identify all but one card of a category (e.g., 5 of 6 suspects), the remaining one MUST be the solution.\n4. You can win by making a correct accusation even without 100% certainty - reasonable deduction based on probabilities is valid.\n\nYou should consider making an accusation when:\n- You have strong evidence for all three components (suspect, weapon, room)\n- A suggestion including certain cards was not challenged by any player\n- Through the process of elimination, you've narrowed down possibilities significantly\n- The potential reward of winning outweighs the risk of being wrong\n\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in the following format.\nIf shouldAccuse is true, provide your deduced solution.\nIf shouldAccuse is false, provide null for accusation components.\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT use markdown code blocks (```json) in your response - just return the JSON object directly.\n\n{\n  \"shouldAccuse\": boolean,\n  \"accusation\": {\n    \"suspect\": \"string | null (your deduced suspect or null)\",\n    \"weapon\": \"string | null (your deduced weapon or null)\",\n    \"room\": \"string | null (your deduced room or null)\"\n  },\n  \"reasoning\": \"string (explain your decision and reasoning)\"\n}",

      "memorySummary": "Current understanding of the game state: Cards in my hand (eliminated from the solution) are Mrs. Peacock, Professor Plum, and Library. Deduced as eliminated are Conservatory, Revolver, Miss Scarlet, Mrs. White, Candlestick, Library, and Dagger. The Conservatory card is deduced as eliminated because Blue Agent's suggestion of Miss Scarlet, Revolver, Conservatory must contain at least one correct card, and both Miss Scarlet and Revolver are already eliminated. The Library card is deduced as eliminated because I showed it to Green Agent, proving it cannot be part of the solution. The Revolver card is deduced as eliminated because it was previously shown by Green Agent and confirmed not to be part of the solution. The Miss Scarlet card is deduced as eliminated because Red Agent showed it to me, proving it cannot be part of the solution. The Mrs. White card is deduced as eliminated because it was previously shown by Red Agent and confirmed not to be part of the solution. The Candlestick card is deduced as eliminated based on Green Agent's suggestion being disproven. The Dagger card is deduced as eliminated because Purple Agent showed it to me, proving it cannot be part of the solution. No strong suspicions or additional insights can be derived beyond the eliminated cards. Recent events, including Yellow Agent's suggestion and Green Agent showing a card to Yellow Agent, do not provide new deductions."

If a suggestion is made and NO PLAYER can challenge it (show any cards), this is strong evidence that ALL THREE suggested cards might be in the solution.\n2. If a suggestion is made and is challenged, at least ONE of the suggested cards is NOT in the solution.\n3. Through elimination: If you can identify all but one card of a category (e.g., 5 of 6 suspects), the remaining one MUST be the solution.\n4. You can win by making a correct accusation even without 100% certainty - reasonable deduction based on probabilities is valid.\n\nYou should consider making an accusation when:\n- You have strong evidence for all three components (suspect, weapon, room)\n- A suggestion including certain cards was not challenged by any player\n- Through the process of elimination, you've narrowed down possibilities significantly\n- The potential reward of winning outweighs the risk of being wrong\n\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in the following format.\nIf shouldAccuse is true, provide your deduced solution.\nIf shouldAccuse is false, provide null for accusation components.\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT use markdown code blocks (```json) in your response - just return the JSON object directly.\n\n{\n  \"shouldAccuse\": boolean,\n  \"accusation\": {\n    \"suspect\": \"string | null (your deduced suspect or null)\",\n    \"weapon\": \"string | null (your deduced weapon or null)\",\n    \"room\": \"string | null (your deduced room or null)\"\n  },\n  \"reasoning\": \"string (explain your decision and reasoning)\"\n}",

No challenge.\nTurn 3: Blue Agent suggested Miss Scarlet, Revolver, Conservatory. Yellow Agent showed a card.\nTurn 5: Green Agent suggested Miss Scarlet, Revolver, Library. Orange Agent showed a card.\nTurn 7: Yellow Agent suggested Miss Scarlet, Revolver, Hall. Red Agent showed a card.\nTurn 9: Purple Agent suggested Miss Scarlet, Revolver, Study.

Green Agent showed a card.\n\nCurrent Turn Events (Turn 33):\nThis turn, you suggested: Mr. Green, Rope, Study.\nResult: Green Agent showed you the card: Study.\n\nIMPORTANT CLUEDO LOGIC:\n1. If a suggestion is made and NO PLAYER can challenge it (show any cards), this is strong evidence that ALL THREE suggested cards might be in the solution.\n2. If a suggestion is made and is challenged, at least ONE of the suggested cards is NOT in the solution.\n3. Through elimination: If you can identify all but one card of a category (e.g., 5 of 6 suspects), the remaining one MUST be the solution.\n4. You can win by making a correct accusation even without 100% certainty - reasonable deduction based on probabilities is valid.\n\nYou should consider making an accusation when:\n- You have strong evidence for all three components (suspect, weapon, room)\n- A suggestion including certain cards was not challenged by any player\n- Through the process of elimination, you've narrowed down possibilities significantly\n- The potential reward of winning outweighs the risk of being wrong\n\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in the following format.\nIf shouldAccuse is true, provide your deduced solution.\nIf shouldAccuse is false, provide null for accusation components.\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT use markdown code blocks (```json) in your response - just return the JSON object directly.\n\n{\n  \"shouldAccuse\": boolean,\n  \"accusation\": {\n    \"suspect\": \"string | null (your deduced suspect or null)\",\n    \"weapon\": \"string | null (your deduced weapon or null)\",\n    \"room\": \"string | null (your deduced room or null)\"\n  },\n  \"reasoning\": \"string (explain your decision and reasoning)\"\n}",

The Conservatory card is deduced as eliminated because Blue Agent's suggestion of Miss Scarlet, Revolver, Conservatory must contain at least one correct card, and both Miss Scarlet and Revolver are already eliminated. The Library card is deduced as eliminated because I showed it to Green Agent, proving it cannot be part of the solution. The Revolver card is deduced as eliminated because it was previously shown by Green Agent and confirmed not to be part of the solution. The Miss Scarlet card is deduced as eliminated because Red Agent showed it to me, proving it cannot be part of the solution. The Mrs. White card is deduced as eliminated because it was previously shown by Red Agent and confirmed not to be part of the solution. The Candlestick card is deduced as eliminated based on Green Agent's suggestion being disproven. The Dagger card is deduced as eliminated because Purple Agent showed it to me, proving it cannot be part of the solution. The Study card is deduced as eliminated based on Purple Agent's suggestion and Green Agent's response. The Hall card is deduced as eliminated because it was previously shown by Blue Agent and confirmed not to be part of the solution. No new deductions can be made from the last turn, and no strong suspicions or additional insights can be derived beyond the eliminated cards."

No challenge.\nTurn 3: Blue Agent suggested Miss Scarlet, Revolver, Conservatory. Yellow Agent showed a card.\nTurn 5: Green Agent suggested Miss Scarlet, Revolver, Library. Orange Agent showed a card.\nTurn 7: Yellow Agent suggested Miss Scarlet, Revolver, Hall. Red Agent showed a card.\nTurn 9: Purple Agent suggested Miss Scarlet, Revolver, Study. Red Agent showed a card.\nTurn 11: Orange Agent suggested Miss Scarlet, Candlestick, Lounge. Red Agent showed a card.\nTurn 13: Red Agent suggested Mrs. White, Candlestick, Lounge. Blue Agent showed a card.\nTurn 15: Blue Agent suggested Miss Scarlet, Revolver, Conservatory. Yellow Agent showed a card.\nTurn 17: Green Agent suggested Miss Scarlet, Candlestick, Library. Yellow Agent showed a card.\nTurn 19: Yellow Agent suggested Mr. Green, Dagger, Hall. Purple Agent showed a card.\nTurn 21: Purple Agent suggested Mr. Green, Dagger, Study.

Purple Agent showed a card.\nTurn 31: Yellow Agent suggested Mr. Green, Rope, Hall. Green Agent showed a card.\nTurn 33: Purple Agent suggested Mr. Green, Rope, Study. Green Agent showed a card.\nTurn 35: Orange Agent suggested Mr. Green, Rope, Lounge. No challenge.\n\nCurrent Turn Events (Turn 35):\nThis turn, you suggested: Mr. Green, Rope, Lounge.\nResult: NO ONE could challenge your suggestion.\n\nIMPORTANT CLUEDO LOGIC:\n1. If a suggestion is made and NO PLAYER can challenge it (show any cards), this is strong evidence that ALL THREE suggested cards might be in the solution.\n2. If a suggestion is made and is challenged, at least ONE of the suggested cards is NOT in the solution.\n3. Through elimination: If you can identify all but one card of a category (e.g., 5 of 6 suspects), the remaining one MUST be the solution.\n4. You can win by making a correct accusation even without 100% certainty - reasonable deduction based on probabilities is valid.\n\nYou should consider making an accusation when:\n- You have strong evidence for all three components (suspect, weapon, room)\n- A suggestion including certain cards was not challenged by any player\n- Through the process of elimination, you've narrowed down possibilities significantly\n- The potential reward of winning outweighs the risk of being wrong\n\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in the following format.\nIf shouldAccuse is true, provide your deduced solution.\nIf shouldAccuse is false, provide null for accusation components.\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT use markdown code blocks (```json) in your response - just return the JSON object directly.\n\n{\n  \"shouldAccuse\": boolean,\n  \"accusation\": {\n    \"suspect\": \"string | null (your deduced suspect or null)\",\n    \"weapon\": \"string | null (your deduced weapon or null)\",\n    \"room\": \"string | null (your deduced room or null)\"\n  },\n  \"reasoning\": \"string (explain your decision and reasoning)\"\n}",
