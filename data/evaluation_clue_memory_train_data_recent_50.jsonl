NEW DEVELOPMENT: Blue's suggestion of Miss Scarlet, Wrench, Lounge received no responses, making these strong solution candidates. This aligns with previous knowledge that Wrench and Lounge were never shown when suggested. Miss Scarlet was previously known to be either held by Green or part of solution - this suggestion strengthens the possibility it's in the solution. Given the lack of responses to this suggestion, there's a strong possibility these three cards are the solution, but we cannot yet confirm this with absolute certainty.
