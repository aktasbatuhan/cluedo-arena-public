The elimination of Mr. Green, Revolver, and Library is newly deduced this turn based on Blue Agent's suggestion and the inability of any player to disprove it.

The elimination of Miss Scarlet, Revolver (now reconfirmed), and Billiard Room was confirmed previously based on Orange Agent's suggestion and the inability of any player to disprove it. The elimination of Study was confirmed previously based on Purple Agent's suggestion and my action of showing it to them. The elimination of Dining Room was confirmed previously based on Orange Agent showing it to me. The elimination of Rope was deduced last turn based on Red Agent's suggestion and the inability of any player to disprove it. My focus remains on verifying the status of Conservatory, as it is still a potential suspect in the solution.

The list of known eliminated cards now includes Lounge, Revolver, Colonel Mustard, Billiard Room, Rope, Mrs. Peacock, Dining Room, Hall, Professor Plum, and newly deduced Dagger. The elimination of Dagger was deduced from Purple Agent's suggestion this turn, as Colonel Mustard and Billiard Room were already eliminated, and no one could disprove the suggestion. My suspicions remain focused on the remaining suspects, weapons, and rooms not yet eliminated. Key insights include the interaction between Yellow and Orange Agents in previous turns, which provided critical information to eliminate multiple cards, Purple Agent's suggestion that led to the elimination of Billiard Room, and Red Agent's suggestion that led to the initial elimination of Rope. Green Agent's suggestion further solidified the elimination of Rope and Lounge. The latest deduction of Dagger adds to the growing list of eliminated cards, narrowing down the possible solution further. The game is progressing with increasing clarity on what cannot be part of the solution, allowing for more focused suspicions on the remaining cards. Purple Agent's actions this turn provided new deductions, while their interaction with Green Agent remains opaque to me but may influence future actions.\n\nEvents from THIS turn:\nRed Agent suggested: Mrs. Peacock, Rope, Hall.\nYou showed Red Agent the card: Hall.\n\nBased ONLY on the information above, what new cards can you definitively deduce are NOT part of the solution?\nRemember: A deduction must be 100% certain.\n\nRespond ONLY with a YAML object in the following format.
